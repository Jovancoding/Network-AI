## Quick Evaluation Checklist

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Can I run it fully offline / air-gapped? | **Yes.** Core orchestration, blackboard, permissions, FSM, budget, and compliance monitor require no network. Only the OpenAI adapter calls an external API — it is opt-in. |
| Do I control all data? | **Yes.** All state lives in your `data/` directory on your own infrastructure. Nothing is transmitted. |
| Is the source auditable? | **Yes.** MIT-licensed, fully open source, no obfuscated code, no telemetry. |
| Does it have an audit trail? | **Yes.** Every permission request, grant, denial, and revocation is appended to `data/audit_log.jsonl` with a UTC timestamp. See [AUDIT_LOG_SCHEMA.md](AUDIT_LOG_SCHEMA.md). |
| Can I plug in my own LLM / provider? | **Yes.** The adapter registry supports 29 adapters: LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, OpenAI Assistants, Haystack, DSPy, Agno, MCP, OpenClaw, A2A, Codex, MiniMax, NemoClaw, APS, Copilot, LangGraph, Anthropic Computer Use, OpenAI Agents SDK, Vertex AI, Pydantic AI, Browser Agent, Hermes (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), Orchestrator, RLM (any RLM-compatible HTTP endpoint), and a `CustomAdapter` for anything else. |
| Does it work with our existing agent framework? | **Yes.** It wraps around your framework — you keep what you have and add guardrails on top. |
| Is there a security review? | **Yes.** CodeQL scanning on every push, Dependabot auto-merge, Socket.dev supply chain score A, OpenSSF Scorecard. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). |
| What does it cost to operate? | **Zero licensing cost.** MIT license. Infrastructure cost = your own compute. |
| Is there a compliance module? | **Yes.** `ComplianceMonitor` enforces configurable violation policies with severity classification and async audit loop. |
| Can I restrict which agents access which resources? | **Yes.** `AuthGuardian` evaluates justification quality + agent trust score + resource risk score before issuing a grant token. |
| Can I isolate environments (dev / staging / prod)? | **Yes.** `EnvironmentManager` enforces a configurable promotion chain (dev → st → sit → qa → preprod → prod) with gate types: auto, confirm, and approval. Config files promote; live state never does. |
| Can agents be blocked from reading outside their sandbox? | **Yes.** `SandboxPolicy.sourceProtection` restricts `FileAccessor.read/write/list` to `data/<env>/` only, throwing `SourceProtectionError` for any out-of-scope path. |

## What It Does (One Paragraph)

Network-AI is a TypeScript/Node.js orchestration layer that sits between your agents and your shared state. It enforces: atomic blackboard writes (no race conditions when two agents write simultaneously), permission gating (agents must request access to sensitive resources and provide a scored justification), budget ceilings (per-agent token limits; rogue agents get cut off mid-task), FSM-based workflow governance (agents are blocked from skipping pipeline stages), and real-time compliance monitoring (tool abuse, turn-taking violations, response timeouts). v5.0 adds: approval inbox (web-accessible approval queue), job queue (persistent priority FIFO with crash recovery), transport layer (JSON-RPC 2.0 with HMAC auth), agent VCR (record/replay for testing), comparison runner (side-by-side adapter evaluation), and 9 new adapters. v5.1.4 adds: RLMAdapter (recursive language model / any RLM-compatible HTTP endpoint), FederatedBudget child spending, blackboard metadata API, PhasePipeline compaction, semaphore-based fan-out, HookContext depth, and sub-goal recursion. v5.3.x adds: Context Throttler (prune blackboard keys per-agent scope), Route Classifier (goal routing + FACTUAL_LOOKUP short-circuit), Partition Planner (non-overlapping agent focus areas), Coverage Gate (recursive completeness refinement), advisory token enforcement in the permission system, and context injection validation in the project context manager. v5.4.0 adds: EnvironmentManager (full promotion chain with backup/rollback), LockedBlackboard env routing (NETWORK_AI_ENV), source protection (FileAccessor scope enforcement), Python NETWORK_AI_ENV support across all five scripts, and 29 CLI env subcommands. v5.4.1 adds: TOCTOU race condition fixes in `_touchJson`/`_touchFile` (CWE-367, CodeQL #149–#150) via `openSync(O_CREAT|O_EXCL)`; unused imports and dead function removed (CodeQL #151–#153). v5.4.2 adds: improved MCP tool descriptions across all 22 tools (behavior on error, return shapes, usage guidelines); ClawHub ASI01/ASI03/ASI06/ASI07 Notes documented as by-design mitigated patterns in SECURITY.md. v5.4.3 adds: ClawHub ASI01/03/06/07 Notes security-findings table added to SKILL.md; README documentation table updated with SKILL.md entry and Code of Conduct/Security Policy footer links; UTF-8 BOM stripped from package.json/skill.json/openapi.yaml (fixed CI ts-node parse failure). v5.4.4 adds: fixed missing `import os` in `scripts/swarm_guard.py` (ClawHub ASI08). v5.5.0 adds: SAP Basis-inspired TransportAgent/LandscapeAgent transport tier; AgentPool.setDispatchPause; ENVIRONMENT_PROMOTE AuthGuardian resource profile; 117 new transport tests. v5.5.1 adds: `revoke_token.py` env-scoped path fix — `_resolve_data_dir()` + `--env` CLI arg ensure token revocation and TTL cleanup target the correct `data/<env>/` directory (ClawScan ASI03). v5.5.2 adds: HMAC-SHA256 grant-token integrity — `check_permission.py` signs each grant with `_sig`; `validate_token.py` rejects tampered records; signing key auto-generated at `data/.signing_key` (stdlib only, zero new deps, ClawScan ASI03). v5.5.3 adds: CodeQL alerts #154–#159 resolved — useless-assignment-to-local dead stores in `transport-agent.ts`, unused `origGet` in `test-transport.ts`, empty-except comment in `check_permission.py`. v5.5.4 adds: SKILL.md scan findings table updated to v5.5.3 scan state — ASI03/ASI06 severity reduced from High to Medium; two new Low findings (local grant state, audit log free text) documented with mitigations. v5.5.5 adds: MAESTRO/OWASP AST framework assessment section added to SKILL.md documenting Network-AI’s architectural mitigations for AST03 (over-privileged skills), AST06 (weak isolation), and AST07 (update drift). v5.5.6 adds: socket.json false-positive suppression for ContextThrottler networkAccess (transitive import-graph false positive from Socket.dev scan). v5.5.7 adds: socket.json shellAccess ignore entries for AgentRuntime and McpToolConsumer (child_process import flagged by Socket.dev shellAccess alert; already covered by shellExec entries — added shellAccess key to close the remaining false positive). v5.5.8 adds: operational hardening — `approvalTimeoutMs` fail-closed timeout for PhasePipeline approval gates (default 5 min); `enforcePromotionChain` opt-in for EnvironmentManager enforcing the full dev→st→sit→qa→preprod→prod sequence; `onCompact` callback now receives archived phase results; adapter discovery failures now logged via console.warn; FederatedBudget persist errors now surface via console.warn; CLI `--json` mode now emits structured error JSON; advisory token clarification in AuthGuardian JSDoc; FileAccessor never-throw contract; LockedBlackboard dirty-read and tie-break semantics documented; streaming auth once-at-start documented. v5.5.9 adds: LockedBlackboard TTL background sweep — `purgeExpired()` on-demand eviction, `startSweep(intervalMs)` / `stopSweep()` background timer (unref’d; default 60 s). v5.6.0 adds: LockedBlackboard WAL crash recovery — Write-Ahead Log (`.wal.jsonl`) records ops before writes and checkpoints after; `replayWAL()` on startup recovers uncommitted ops from process crashes; `compactWAL()` for manual truncation. v5.6.1 adds: Circuit Breaker on AdapterRegistry — `CircuitBreaker` class (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN), `CircuitOpenError`, per-adapter breakers, `fallbackChain`, `getCircuitState()`, `resetCircuit()`; `circuit:open/half-open/close` events on `AdapterEventType`; zero new runtime dependencies. v5.7.0 adds: `ITelemetryProvider` BYOT abstraction — `NullTelemetryProvider` (default no-op), `CapturingTelemetryProvider` (in-memory for tests), `createOtelHooks(provider)` factory wires `beforeExecute` / `afterExecute` / `onError` spans into `AdapterHookManager`; plug in any OTel SDK without modifying adapters; zero new runtime dependencies. v5.7.1 adds: CodeQL fixes — `compactWAL()` TOCTOU race condition (CWE-367) resolved; unused imports and useless assignment removed from test-phase11.ts. v5.7.2 adds: **Security fix GHSA-r78r-rwrf-rjwp** — `McpSseServer._isAuthorized()` fail-closed on empty secret (CWE-306/CWE-862 incomplete fix); `listen()` rejects if secret is absent; `McpSseTransport` accepts `secret` param for automatic bearer auth.
